 ## Branches
Definition: A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit. The default branch when a new repository is initialized is called the master branch.
Purpose: Branches enable developers to work on changes without disrupting the current working state. By creating a new branch, experimentation is possible without breaking existing functionality.
Commands:
git branch (to list, create, and delete branches).
git checkout (to switch branches by updating the working tree to match the selected branch).
git checkout -b <new_branch> (to create a new branch and switch to it in one command).

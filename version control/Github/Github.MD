## 3. GitHub
**Overview**: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers version control and additional features like bug tracking, wikis, and task management.

**Distributed Nature**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository on their local machine.

**Commands**:
- `git push` (to update the remote repository with local changes).
- `git pull` (to fetch updates from the remote and merge them).

**Remote Repositories**: Used for collaboration, Git stores copies of commits in remote branches. Developers use `git fetch` to retrieve updates without merging and `git pull` to retrieve and merge updates.
